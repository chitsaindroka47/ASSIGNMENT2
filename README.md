React To-Do List App
Hey there! This is a simple and colorful To-Do List app built with React. It helps you keep track of your tasks easily with a nice gradient background to brighten up your day.

What it does
Add tasks quickly — no empty tasks allowed!

Mark tasks as done or undo them with a click.

Delete tasks you’ve finished or don’t want anymore.

Filter your list to see all tasks, just the active ones, or only the completed ones.

Sort tasks alphabetically whenever you want.

Your tasks are saved right in your browser, so they’ll still be there even if you refresh or close the page.

Looks good too, thanks to a smooth colorful gradient background!

How to get it running
Clone the repo to your computer:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

Go inside the folder:
cd your-repo

Install all the needed packages:
npm install

Start the app locally:
npm start

Now open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see your To-Do List!

How to use it
Type in your task and hit the Add button.

Click Complete next to a task to mark it done or undo it if you change your mind.

Click Delete to remove tasks you no longer want to see.

Use the filter buttons (All, Active, Completed) to organize your view.

Want to sort tasks? Just hit the Sort button!

Close your browser or refresh — your list will stay safe thanks to localStorage.
